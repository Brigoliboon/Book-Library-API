# Book-Library-API
This API is a serverless API that only stores functions as a part of my side project named World Library. This API is deployed in Vercel.

# World Library
World Library is a Java application side project that I am currently working on. The aim and goal of this project is to provide free resource books for readers across the world for free.

# Issues
  - Conflict with https://pdfdrive.to/robots.txt (but is working on local)
  - lack of query options
  - No API key

# Working on:
  - Robots.txt bypass
  - RESTAPI security implementation
  - Tokens
    - Session ID
    - Auth Key
    - Private API key/s
